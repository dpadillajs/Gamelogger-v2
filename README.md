# Gamelogger (Version 2.0 w/ Sequelize)

Gamelogger is another server-based application deployed within Heroku that utitlizes Node.js, Express,js, Handlebars.js, MySQL, and ORM. I was inspired by my friend Nick who tracks his videogame progressions to make Gamelogger a reality.

**In this version of Gamelogger, I replaced the manually created ORM with Sequelize.**
